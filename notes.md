### Software Optimization

1. **Efficient Data Handling**:
   - Minimize the use of long data types where possible and use `int` or `unsigned int` for sum and mean calculations if they are within range, to speed up arithmetic operations.
   - Consider fixed-point arithmetic for calculations if floating-point precision is not necessary, which can be faster on microcontrollers without a floating-point unit (FPU).

2. **Loop Unrolling**:
   - In cases where the resolution is fixed and known at compile time, manually unrolling loops can reduce loop overhead and conditional checking.

3. **Reduce Serial Output**:
   - Serial communication can significantly slow down your loop, especially at higher baud rates. Minimize the amount of data sent over Serial, or reduce the frequency of Serial prints.
   - limit it to only one print out of 10

4. **Optimize Delay**:
   - Adjust or remove the delay at the end of your loop if real-time performance is critical. Be cautious, as removing the delay might increase the polling rate more than necessary, wasting processing power.

### Algorithmic Improvements

1. **Running Variance Calculation**:
   - Instead of calculating variance from scratch on each loop iteration, consider a running variance calculation that updates with each new measurement set. This approach can significantly reduce the computational load.

3. **Use of Approximations**:
   - For applications where exact precision is not critical, consider using approximation methods for mathematical operations that are computationally expensive.
   - we can use Approximations


### Hardware Optimization


3. **Parallel Processing**:
   - If you're running other tasks besides the sensor reading and processing, consider using the ESP32's dual cores to parallelize tasks. For example, one core can handle sensor communication and the other core can process the data or manage communication.

4. **Direct Memory Access (DMA)**:
   - For more advanced use cases, consider using DMA for I2C data transfers if supported by the ESP32 and your development environment. This can offload the CPU from the burden of byte-wise data transfer.
